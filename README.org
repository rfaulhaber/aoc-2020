#+TITLE: Advent of Code 2020

My solutions for Advent of Code 2020 in various languages, aka "My Tour of
Functional Programming Languages."

If you're an Emacs and Nix user (such as myself), you can turn each solution
buffer into an ad-hoc language IDE using the =dir-locals.nix= file. Or you can
just as easily run any of my solutions using the relevant nix-shell file under
=shells/=.
